## Phase 3: Out of Scope (Deferred)

The following features are explicitly out of scope for this platform's focus:

- ❌ **Bank API Integration** — Manual import is sufficient; APIs add maintenance burden
- ❌ **Automated Transaction Sync** — No banking integration (manual import only)
- ❌ **Webhook Support** — Not needed without external service integration
- ❌ **IFTTT/Zapier Integration** — Overkill for personal/family use case
- ❌ **Public API** — Freemium model focuses on app, not third-party integrations
- ❌ **End-to-End Encryption** — Freemium tier doesn't justify infrastructure complexity
- ❌ **Gamification** — Streaks, badges, leaderboards out of scope
- ❌ **Expense Splitting** — Manual tracking sufficient; revisit if high-demand
- ❌ **Mobile Native Apps** — Web-first with responsive design; PWA planned later
- ❌ **Predictive ML Models** — Advanced ML reserved for premium tier (future)
